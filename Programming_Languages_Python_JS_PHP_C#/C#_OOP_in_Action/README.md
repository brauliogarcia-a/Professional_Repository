# C# Object-Oriented Programming Projects
This repository contains a collection of C# projects developed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Originally created as part of the CSE 210 – Programming with Classes course, this repository now serves as a professional showcase of my ability to design modular, maintainable, and scalable applications in C#.

# Overview
Each folder in this repository represents a project designed to practice and apply different programming concepts:

* sandbox/ – A space for testing C# code snippets and exploring language features.

* csharp-prep/ – Introductory exercises for understanding basic C# syntax and logic.

* prepare/ – Learning activities that emphasize key programming concepts and class design.

* prove/ – Developer projects applying OOP principles in real scenarios.

* final/ – A comprehensive final project integrating all major concepts learned.


# Object-Oriented Programming in Action
This repository illustrates the four foundational OOP principles through practical examples:

* Abstraction – Simplifies complex operations by dividing the code into separate components.
Example: Using a Video class to represent individual videos while managing them through a list that abstracts the underlying structure. 

* Encapsulation – Protects class data using access modifiers and getter/setter methods.
Example: Implementing a Product class with protected variables accessed only through getters and setters

* Inheritance – Reuses functionality across classes to reduce redundancy.
Example: Creating an Event base class and inheriting its attributes and methods across different event types.

* Polymorphism – Enables flexibility by allowing method overriding and behavior customization.
Example: Overriding base class methods to implement specific functionality depending on context.

# Technologies Used

* Language: C# (.NET 6 / .NET Core)

* IDE: Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio

* Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* Version Control: Git & GitHub

# Learning Outcome

This project demonstrates how well-structured code can simplify maintenance, improve scalability, and encourage reusability—skills that directly translate to professional software development environments.
