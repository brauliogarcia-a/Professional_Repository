        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the church for the last 13 years. I served a mission and later I meet my wife and we got married in the temple. We have a cute 4-year-old daughter, and people say she looks a lot like me, but I think she looks like my wife too :)</p>
        <p>The church is a great part of my life, I have a testimony that our Heavenly Father exists and Jesus Christ is our savior, truly the gospel is the pearl of great price.</p>
        <p>This is my third and last attempt to complete a career, for different reasons I could not finish college in Mexican schools, but I'm grateful that BYU I offer careers online, I can say the quality of the learning is incredible, not to mention the spiritual part makes it perfect.</p>
        <p>I have been in the IT field for the last 12 or 13 years, even on my mission I had the opportunity to give my technological skills to the church. I like technology, sometimes I'm passionate about it, as other classmates I like videogames and is a hobby that has become more interesting in the last years. Curiously,  I like art too, I have been writing poems for the last 14 years, and I like to read a lot. Someday I will try to write a book, currently, I'm reading 5 different books about it and watching some courses to have a solid start.</p>
        <p>My actual job its been a web analyst at NXP, and is something I really enjoy even if the work is hard sometimes. my position is so extensive that databases are one of the skills I need for my job. </p>
        <p>I wish you the best this semester and I hope we work together to learn more.</p>
        <p>Regards,</p>
